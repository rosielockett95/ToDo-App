A full-stack todo application built to practise both front-end and back-end development fundamentals. The app allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks, with todos persisting via a Node.js and Express backend.

This project was created as part of my learning journey into software development, with a focus on understanding how a front end communicates with a backend API and how data persistence works in a real application.
